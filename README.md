<h1>Analyzing Network Traffic and Implementing Network Security Groups</h1>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
This project involves the creation of two virtual machines and the utilization of Wireshark to examine various network traffic. Additionally, Network Security Groups will be accessed via Azure to allow or block ICMP traffic. Completion of this project aims to give the user a better understanding of ports, network protocols, remote desktop protocol, command line use, and a basic proficiency of a network analyzer tool, such as Wireshark.
<h2>Platforms and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machine Deployment)
- Azure Resource Group (Contains VM's)
- Command Prompt (Communication with the Operating System)
- Wireshark (Network Traffic Analyzer Tool)
- SSH (Accessing Linux Terminal)
  - TCP Port 22
- DNS (Conversion of strings and letters into IP addresses)
  - TCP and UDP Port 53
- DHCP (IP Address Allocation)
  - TCP Ports 67 and 68
- RDP (Remotely Accessing Virtual Machines)
  - TCP Port 3389

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 Pro
- Linux (Ubuntu Server 20.04)

<h2>Project Installation Steps</h2>

- Step 1
  - Create a Resource Group within Microsoft Azure

- Step 2  - within the Resource Group that was created
  - Create an Azure Virtual Machine running a Windows 10 Pro Image
  - Make sure to place this Virtual Machine into the resource group that was created
  - Ensure that 2 Virtual CPU's are selected for each Virtual Machine

- Step 3
  - Repeat the same process and create a Virtual Machine with an Ubuntu Server Image
  - Make sure that both Virtual Machines are on the same Virtual Network

- Step 4
  - Utilizing RDP on Windows, remote into Virtual Machine 1 (Windows Pro) - by typing in the IP Address
  - If using a Mac computer, go to the app store and download the Microsoft Remote Desktop application
  - You will be prompted with a login screen - use the credentials you provided during the virtual machine creation process

- Step 5
  - Once you are booted into the Virtual Machine, proceed to download Wireshark
  - Type in "Download Wireshark" on a Google Search

- Step 6
  - Once you are finished downloading Wireshark, boot up Wireshark by searching for the program towards the bottom left corner of the screen

- Step 7
  - Once you are in Wireshark, be sure to select Ethernet

- Step 8
  - You will begin to see multiple streams of network traffic be displayed
  - Above the network traffic, where it says "Apply a Display Filter" in the white box, type in whatever traffic you would like to be displayed
  - Have fun analyzing network traffic!

<h2>Project Demonstration</h2>

  - We can see there is a connection established between VM1 and VM2 via the non-stop ping command
    - ping 10.0.0.5 -t
      - This command can be entered into command prompt by typing "cmd" in the start menu below
        - Make sure that before clicking cmd, right-click and select "run as administrator"
- 10.0.0.5 is the private IP Address of our Linux Virtual Machine

- We will now block this connection by going back to Microsoft Azure, and typing in "Network Security Groups" into the search bar
- On the left, we can click the "Inbound Security Rules" tab, and click the add button - this tab is selected because we want to block any ICMP traffic coming into VM2, hence the word "inbound"
- Be sure to select ICMP as the protocol and the deny option
  - ICMP stands for Internet Control Message Protocol, and is the protocol that is used when using the ping command
- Lastly, select the add button, and the security rule will be created

![image](https://github.com/chriskhawaja/azure-network-protocols/assets/153021794/ca61784b-48d5-4c3d-86fc-db57538c90a9)
- Now, we can observe that any traffic being sent to VM2 is being blocked

  ![image](https://github.com/chriskhawaja/azure-network-protocols/assets/153021794/25ae8002-6238-4782-bf84-f59863d0d4a3)
- We can reverse this process by going back to our NSG for VM2, selecting the rule we created, and clicking the allow button under ICMP
- Be sure to press "save" and the rule will be created

- We can see the replies from VM2 coming back after we changed the inbound rule 

![image](https://github.com/chriskhawaja/azure-network-protocols/assets/153021794/dcaf8831-58c9-4eee-8774-a0f187424535)
- Utilizing SSH, we can also acces the Linux terminal of VM2 from VM1
  - To access VM2 using VM1, be sure to input SSH Username@IP Address
    - The username and IP address of the VM that you are trying to access

- Once we filter for Remote Desktop Protocol traffic, we can see the inundation of traffic
  - This is because we are literally using RDP to access our VM

- After visiting different websites on our VM, we can see all the DNS information on Wireshark
- Additionally after utilizing the command "ipconfig /displaydns", we can see that our cache is full of information

  ![image](https://github.com/chriskhawaja/azure-network-protocols/assets/153021794/4f6a5650-6f0a-46c3-ba8b-602a661b59c9)
- To flush our DNS cache, we can use the "ipconfig /flushdns" command
  - This command is really important when users are experiencing a multitude of DNS issues

- To view our DHCP and DNS servers, we can type the command "ipconfig /all" into command prompt

  ![image](https://github.com/chriskhawaja/azure-network-protocols/assets/153021794/e20a6d00-e5f7-4516-9a66-daf11afcfbaf)
- DHCP traffic can be analyzed by using the "ipconfig /release" and "ipconfig /renew" commands
  - The release command will tell our DHCP server to get rid of our current IP address, which was given to us via DHCP
  - The renew command will give us a new allocated IP address that is dynamically given via DHCP
  - Note that when you use these commands, your connection may be lost since we have "released" the VM's current IP address
 
  ![image](https://github.com/chriskhawaja/azure-network-protocols/assets/153021794/cad81990-28a6-4ddd-aea6-5eee091ed677)
  - You can now see in Wireshark, the steps of DHCP release and renewal
    - The DORA process highlights how a Client and DHCP Server communicate
      - Discovery, Offer, Request, and Acknowledge
